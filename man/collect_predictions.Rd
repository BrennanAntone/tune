\usage{
collect_predictions(x, nest_by = "nothing", wflow = NULL)

collect_metrics(x, nest_by = "nothing", summarize = TRUE,
  wflow = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The results of \code{tune_grid()} or \code{tune_bayes()}. For
\code{collect_predictions()}, the control option \code{save_pred = TRUE} should have
been used.}

\item{nest_by}{A character string to indicate which (if any) columns should
be in the resulting tibble and which should be nested. Values are \code{"nothing"}
(i.e. no nesting), \code{"resamples"} (nest the parameter values), and \code{"parameters"}
(nest the resamples).}

\item{wflow}{The workflow associated with the results (only required for
\code{nest_by = "parameters"}).}

\item{summarize}{A logical; should metrics be summarized over resamples
(\code{TRUE}) or return the values for each individual resample. Only appropriate
when \code{nest_by = "nothing"}.}
}
\value{
A tibble. The column names depend on the results and the mode of the
model.

# Summarized over resamples
collect_metrics(ames_grid_search)

# Per-resample values
